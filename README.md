# Bullseye Model
Bullseye Model is an approach to modeling software. The model looks at software in the shape of a bullseye target, in which the outer-most ring is the overall technical scope of the services and the inner-most ring is the specifics of code implementation in that same service.

## Goal
The of the Bullseye Model is help you avoid situations (and we've all been there) where you think something is rather simple, but find yourself trying to figure out the logic of your code during the coding process. This can end up being a colossal waste of time while you rethink things, realize things you hadn't thought about, and inevitably have to re-write a lot of your code.

Idealy, you're software has already been thought through by the time you start coding, resulting in clearer code and more reliable, scalable software.

## Leading Principles
### 1. Recognition that there is no one true way of doing something.
While the Bullseye Model does  suggest specific exercises to use when thinking through each layer, they are merely suggestions and shouldn't be considered requirements. The only thing that is a requirement is that each layer be considered and thought through. In other words, if you (or your team) want to write a five page essay describing how something will work instead of creating a diagram, have at it - just as long as it's considered and thought through.

### 2. Inclusion
It's  important that all people and team members be able to contribute. That said, it's important to remember that the degree to which you can architect and think about something is likely dependent on your experience level. As such, the Bullseye Model isn't going to teach you everything you need to know about all aspects of software development, however will help break things down in such a way that will point more junior developers in the right direction(s).

## Approach
As mentioned before, the Bullseye Model uses a bullseye target to map out the layers of software architecture. Those layers are as follows:
